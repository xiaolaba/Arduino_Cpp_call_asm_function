# Arduino_Cpp_call_asm_function  
For AVR MCU, Framework and learning, build assembler subroutine, call from C++, Arduino IDE is C++  

Arduino IDE 1.8.12 is C++, skectch is named *.ino, considered C or C++ of programming source code, underneath is avr-gcc.  

build subrotuine, named as test.S, avr assembler language for avr-gcc.  

example and how to build/compile these two source code, Arduino IDE 1.8.12 is used.  

hardward used, Arduino Nano, onbroad LED is connected to PB5 of ATmega8/168/328p, or arduino pin# D13  

Two funcitons designed with test.S, uses LED_TOOGLE as example to describe the design flow,  

in test.S, define the name of fuction, LED_TOGGLE,  
```  
.global LED_TOGGLE  // avr-gcc will see this as asm subroutine and callable  
  
```  

in test.S, the actual function body,  
```  
LED_TOGGLE: // start of our function  
  (your_code) // any code  
  ret       // finish of our function, return to caller, out C++ program  
  
```  

in testC_callASM.ino, define the name to call our function, it is also saying "fuction prototype", key to success,   
extern "C" {your_fuction_prototype} for C++ compiler  
extern your_fuction_prototype; // for C version  
```  
//Assembler function is external, avr-gcc uses register r24 to pass argument or parameter when calling  
  
//function prototype for C++ compiler  
extern "C" {  
  void LED_TOGGLE(void); // for C++ version, Arduino IDE 1.8.12.  
}  
  
// function prototype for C compiler  
extern void LED_TOGGLE(void); // for C version  
```  
  
  
in testC_callASM.ino, call our ASM function,  
```  
  //LEDFLASH(value);  // parameter pass to ASM routine, r24 used   
  LED_TOGGLE(); // call ASM subroutine, no parameter  
```  
  
### test result  
compile and burn the code to Arduino Nano, onbroad LED (connrect to D13, ATmega168 port pin name is PB5) is blinking.
